 notice how much cleaner this approach is then having all the routes in your index file 
 the 1st argument for the `use` method is the root path for the route, the 2nd argument is the routes for that path

 For example: The /auth path is the root path and we are passing in all the routes for that path
   1. GET /auth/signup
   2. POST /auth/signup
   3. GET /auth/login
   4. POST /auth/login
